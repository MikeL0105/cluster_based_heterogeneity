# The used originates from the National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM - https://studentexperiencenetwork.org/national-mindset-study/). The dataset has been modified to a semi-synthetic datasat and has been generated for the Atlantic Causal Inference Conference 2018. The workshop organizers removed privacy sensitive information, while still maintaining similar characteristics such as the covariate distributions, data structures, and effect sizes. 

# The dataset contains information on approximately 10,000 students across 76 schools in the US. These 10,000 students were originally randomly assigned to a growth mindset program through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). However, the randomness of treatment assignment has been modified with the introduction of additional confounding. This means that this dataset is now considered an observational study. The dataset includes a simulated continuous outcome variable that represents the achievement level of the students, a binary treatment variable that incates the receipt of treatment, and 10 other covariates.
